## About The Project

This project has been undertaken as part of the final year proposal for the Informatics and computer science class, Faculty of Information Technology - Strathmore University.

It aims at illustrating the concept and does not depict a current system that would be deployed at the market level.

## Brief description

Within the healthcare industry, most facilities operate with independant systems with no proper channels of communicating medical records of patients when referrals occur, and these occur quite often due to this or that other reason. While health professionals agree that a proper medical history is very important in delivering the best care to patients, the lack of information sharing consensus and means of securily and effectively sharing information still hinder the best delivery of care possible.

We aim at developing a application programming interface (API) that would serve as a mean of sharing relevant medical information of patients between hospitals when referrals occur. With the use of a unique identifier assigned to patients, the tracking and sharing of their medical data when necessary would be enhanced with the referrals' system. 

Hence the title:
### Towards sharing referral information of patients across health facilities.

Again, the development of this system is limited to the finals of the bachelor's degree in the faculty of Information Technology at Strathmore University and helps the student that I am to apply the different concepts and skills into building a system for improvement, hereby  to the healthcare industry.
